The R version can be found [here](https://www.statlearning.com/resources-second-edition). 
I implemented the lab in Python trying to follow step-by-step what the authors propose in their book 
and [course](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:StanfordOnline+STATSX0001+1T2022/). 
Sharing here in case it is useful to anyone else.
